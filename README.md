# C Introduction
What is C?
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
It is a very popular language, despite being old.
C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

# Why Learn C?
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world;
- If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp), [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php), etc, as the syntax is similar;
- C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like [Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) and [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp);
- C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies;

# Difference between C and C++
- C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax;
- The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

# Get Started With C
To start using C, you need two things:
- A text editor, like Notepad, to write C code;
- A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand.
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from.

# C Install IDE
An IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*) is used to edit AND compile the code.
Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.

**Note:** Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.

You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the *mingw-setup.exe* file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
